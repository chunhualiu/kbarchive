	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
